This timeline aims to present the various MVC pieces in isolation as
much as possible and get some good reps in on the various pieces
before jumping into Rails proper.

This is simply a loose outline, and may change depending on class
progress and student interests. We may also reschedule to make the
most of opportunities that present themselves along the way.

## Week 1 - Basic Ruby

By the end of this week students should be

* Comfortable with Ruby syntax and control flow constructs
* Used to both running scripts directly and interacting with them via
  e.g. Pry
* Exposed to testing ideas (via e.g. Ruby Koans), if not necessarily
  comfortable TDD'ing things themselves

## Week 2 - OO Design

* Classes, subclasses, modules and mixins
* Heavy emphasis on understanding local variable vs. method
  vs. instance variable - visibility and scoping
* More familiarity with testing.

## Week 3 - Models

* Introduce databases, SQL and Camping models
* Adapt projects from week 2 to be persistent
* Projects driven either via command line scripts or by tests where
  appropriate

## Week 4 - Controllers

* Introduce HTTP protocol, how the web works
* Poke around with some APIs - Github, Spotify are good
* Write our own Camping controllers and interact with them via
  e.g. Postman
* At this point, could deploy to Heroku

## Week 5 - Views

* Cover the HTML bestiary (esp. the various relevant form elements)
* CSS and design
* Can finally build a full-scale MVC app. Should probably do so to
  prepare for ...

## Week 6 - Rails!

* Cover project organization, conventions
* Command line helpers, scaffolding
* Migrate the project from last week to Rails. Compare and contrast
  pain points.
* Tools for testing with Rails - Capybara, factories

## Week 7 - Rails Patterns

Look at some of the common patterns and exensions, like

* Authentication systems, Devise (omniauth?), API token auth
* Authorization, /(can){2,3}/
* Pagination (kaminari, will_paginate)
* File uploads (paperclip, carrier_wave)
* Search (pg extensions? Mention ES?)
* Mailers (background workers? ... once 4.2 is out, it'd make sense to
  mention that here)

## Week 8 - Javascript

* DOM manipulation with (and without?) jQuery
* UJS
* AJAX
* Asset pipeline, vendoring JS

## Week 9 - 10

Can be more flexible, depending on interests and progress of the
class. Some combination of

* Deeper look into client-side frameworks, probably React or Backbone
* Peek into DevOps, e.g. look at Capistrano, Ansible, maybe Vagrant or
  Docker?
* Soft-skills - scrum and estimation (I'd like to get students working
  in small groups with something like a designated scrummaster at this
  point - that's a good way to push your more advanced students to
  work on non-technical skills)

## Week 11 - 12

Review and projects

Optional guest lectures:

* Rubinius/Languages vs Implementations/"Static" vs "Dynamic" languages
* Lisp/Clojure and a brief exploration of Macros

More TBD
