### Manifesto

[Read it Here](http://masondesu.github.io/code-school-manifesto/)

### Absence policy

You can miss up to 4 lectures; after that, your job placement
guarantee is forfeit. I don't recommend missing any, as we will be
moving very fast.

### Late homework policy

Your homework is due by 8 AM on the day it is due. After that, it is
late.  Like the absence policy, you can turn in homework late 4 times,
although I do not recommend it.

I would rather see a solid attempt on time than a complete assignment
late. Solid attempts are not considered late.

### Honor code

You are expected to do your own work. You should use all resources
available to you, including open-source code, but copy and pasting
open-source code is prohibited: you should use it only for inspiration
or as a library in a bigger project.

Copying homework is taken very seriously and can result in forfeiting
job placement.
